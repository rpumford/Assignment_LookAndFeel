            <p>Traveladventures was not a guide for the average tourist. It was not where you would find the best place to buy tacky souvenirs, sell you generic guided tours, or highlight the same old tourist attractions.</p>
            <p>We feature the vibrant neighborhoods around the world where contemporary arts and culture thrive and tolerance is celebrated. It was the quintessential exploration guide made by and for the urban creatives.</p>
            <p>
                Traveladventures was a collaborative effort with hundreds of designers, artists and creatives companies around the world who shared their favorite local hangouts. Their guides were carefully crafted from scratch and filled with exceptional recommendations so travelers could experience any city like a local. Whether you prefered boutiques or mom &amp; pop shops, cocktail bars or dive bars, fine cuisine or crab shacks, galleries or street art, we had you covered.

                We want to bring exciting places anywhere in the world closer to our audience. Not only through our travel writing, but mostly through our travel photography, we show the world around us in a real, honest and sometimes sarcastic way. We’re excited to take a new direction with our travel writing and photography and hope you’ll enjoy our work.
